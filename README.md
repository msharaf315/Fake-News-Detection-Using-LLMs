Addressing the intricate challenge of fake news
detection, traditionally reliant on the expertise of professional
fact-checkers due to the inherent uncertainty in fact-checking
processes. We compare different machine learning, deep learning
and LLM modelsâ€™ performance on fake news detection task.
This research proposes using large language models as feature
extractors instead of using them end-to-end for this task. The
evaluation is conducted on the well-established LIAR dataset,
a prominent benchmark for fake news detection research. Our
study presents detailed comparisons and ablation experiments
on the LIAR. The proposed approach aims to enhance our
understanding of dataset characteristics, contributing to refining
and improving fake news detection methodologies.
